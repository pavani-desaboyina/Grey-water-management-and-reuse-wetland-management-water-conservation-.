 Algorithm to Instruct All Sensors in AI Sensor Tanker
Step 1: Start the System
Power on the AI sensor tanker system.

Initialize all sensor modules.

Step 2: Activate and Calibrate Sensors
Activate pH Sensor → measure acidity or alkalinity of grey water.

Activate Turbidity Sensor → detect the clarity and presence of suspended particles.

Activate TDS Sensor → measure total dissolved solids in water.

Activate Temperature Sensor → monitor water temperature (affects purification).

Activate Volume Sensor / Flow Meter → measure how much water is collected.

Activate Durability Sensor → check filter condition and water pressure stability.

Step 3: Collect Sensor Data
Continuously read all sensor values.

Send the readings to the AI control unit.

Store sensor data in a local or cloud database.

Step 4: Analyze Sensor Data with AI
AI compares sensor readings with standard water quality thresholds.

If readings are outside safe range:

Instruct Chemical Dispenser to add necessary chemicals.

Adjust Filtration System time and flow rate.

Update readings after every adjustment cycle.

Step 5: Recheck and Validate
Sensors re-measure pH, turbidity, and TDS after treatment.

If all readings fall within normal range:

AI declares “Fresh Water Ready.”

If not, instruct sensors to continue monitoring and repeat purification.

Step 6: Shutdown and Maintenance Check
After purification, sensors run a quick self-diagnosis for errors.

AI stores sensor performance data for learning and maintenance alerts.
